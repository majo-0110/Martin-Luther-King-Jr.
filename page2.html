      <td colspan="4"><p data-start="0" data-end="2932" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Martin Luther King Jr., born on January 15, 1929, in the African-American neighborhood of Sweet Auburn in Atlanta, Georgia, was the most emblematic leader of the civil rights movement in the United States and one of the most influential advocates for equality of the twentieth century; coming from a deeply religious family committed to justice—son of pastor Martin Luther King Sr. and Alberta Williams King, and brother to Christine and A.D.—he grew up surrounded by teachings of faith, education, and social responsibility, which shaped his vision from an early age. He studied sociology at Morehouse College, then theology at Crozer Theological Seminary, and finally earned a doctorate at Boston University, becoming a pastor in 1954 at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, where he began organizing the African-American community to challenge the segregation laws of the South. His first major national impact came with the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955, which he led following the arrest of Rosa Parks, lasting 381 days until the Supreme Court declared bus segregation unconstitutional, establishing him as a national leader. </p>
        <p data-start="0" data-end="2932" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Later, he founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to coordinate nonviolent protests across the country, inspired by Gandhi's philosophy of peaceful resistance, and from there he led key campaigns such as the Birmingham Campaign in 1963, where he faced arrests and police violence and wrote the influential &ldquo;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&rdquo; defending civil disobedience as a moral tool against injustice. That same year, he was one of the main organizers of the historic March on Washington, where he delivered his iconic &ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo; speech to over 250,000 people, becoming a global symbol of hope and equality. His activism was decisive in passing two of the most important civil rights laws in the United States: the Civil Rights Act of 1964—which prohibited segregation and workplace discrimination—and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which guaranteed African Americans the right to vote, and for his leadership, he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, becoming the youngest person at the time to receive it.</p>
      <p data-start="0" data-end="2932" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""> He also expanded his fight to the northern United States through the Chicago Freedom Campaign, focused on addressing poverty, housing discrimination, and structural violence, and spoke out strongly against the Vietnam War, considering it unjust and harmful to the poor. In 1968, he launched the Poor People&rsquo;s Campaign, a national movement demanding economic justice, fair wages, and real opportunities for marginalized people of all races; however, his life was cut short when he was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, while supporting striking sanitation workers, leaving an immense legacy as a global symbol of equality, justice, human dignity, and peaceful resistance, whose teachings continue to inspire social movements worldwide.</p></td>
